<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>My name is Gloria Hernandez, and I currently work as a Senior Business Analyst 
  for a financial services company. I've worked in operations for 10+ years and am
  hoping to pivot into the Technology field, specifically into an automation or 
  worflow orchestration role. I recently graduated from Louisiana State University
  (LSU) with my bachelor's degree in General Business with an IT Management concentration.
  This summer I plan to enroll in a Master's MIS, IS, or IT program. However, in the meantime,
  I am taking Udemy classes to build up my technical skills.</p>
