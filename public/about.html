  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <hr/>
  <p>My name is Gloria Hernandez, and I currently work as a Senior Business Analyst 
  for a financial services company. I've worked in operations for 10+ years and am
  hoping to pivot into the Technology field, specifically into an automation role.
  I recently graduated from Louisiana State University (LSU) with my bachelor's 
  degree in General Business with an IT Management concentration.
  This summer I plan to enroll in a Master's MIS, IS, or IT program. However, in the meantime,
  I am taking Udemy classes to build up my technical skills some of which helped me build and
  publish this website.</p>

  <p>Have a look at my online portfolio. If you like what you see, head over to the 
  <a href="./contact.html">Contact</a> page for my contact info. 
  Thank you for your time and have a great day!</p>
